    <string name="descarts_sqare_technique"><p>Do you want to make conscious decision?\n Then \"Descartes Square\" technique will help you to do so.\n
    Answer four questions.\n
    1) What will be if it happens?\n
    2) What will be if it doesn\'t happen?\n
    3) What won\'t be if it happens?\n
    4) What won\'t be if it doesn\'t happen?\n
    This technique will help you to sort all inner concerns and objections out.\n\n
In detail\n\n
Start from \"Make a decision\". Type a question and press \"+\".\n
Can you see a square with four questions and a diagram? Choose any of them and start answering. How important is it for you? Evaluate from 1 to 5. The higher mark the more important it is for you.
Press \"+\".\n
Make your work easier: give as many answers as you can in each square, evaluate them in preference manner – it will help you to sort everything out.\n
You can use a diagram after all will be filled in. It will show the most suitable option for you (in percentage).\n
        At any point you can come back to \"My decisions\" in the main menu. If you choose one of decisions you will see Descartes Square again and after clicking each square you will see the list of your previous answers. It can be modified. You can add answers to any square by pressing \"+\". You can also delete an answer by durable press on it.\n
It is possible to delete all decisions by pressing \"My decisions\"\/ x\" or edit each particular decision by durable press on it.\n
        Enjoy and make right decisions!\n</p></string>
